I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [**IMPRS-IS Program, T&uuml;bingen**](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/), where I am part of [**EML**](https://eml-unitue.de/) and [**MIDAS**](http://midaslab.org/) group, and I work closely with [**Prof. Zeynep Akata**](https://eml-unitue.de/people/zeynep-akata) and [**Prof. Sergios Gatidis**](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/das-klinikum/mitarbeiter/profil/1479).
I am fascinated by interdisciplinary R&D happening at the intersection of 
Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Biomedical and Healthcare Informatics.
These days I am exploring Bayesian Deep Learning, Uncertainty Estimation, Generative models, and Explainable AI (XAI).

Earlier, I was an undergrad at Computer Science and Engineering@IIT-Bombay. 

BTW, [**here's**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A) a cool lofi track that I find helpful while working.
<br/>
[**Here's**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obCjODeoLVw) a video of Prof. R. Feynman talking about Mathematicians and Physicists. <br/>
I believe something similar can be said for Researchers and Engineers.
